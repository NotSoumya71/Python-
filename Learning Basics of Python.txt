Basics of Python:

Compiler and Interpreter - A compiler is a program used to convert the code into binary for the computer to understand. An interpreter is also a program used to convert code into binary. However, a compiler converts all the code at once and executes it, while an interpreter converts the code line by line and informs us about any error before executing it.

Note:- A lot of languages use the combination of compiler and interpreter.
For example: Java, Python, etc.


Python - python is a programming language.
Why it is special :
1. It has easier syntax as compared to other languages.
2. It is a high-level language.
3. It is an object oriented programming language.
4. It has tons of libraries for any specific task.


Algorithms - algorithms are set of codes or instructions that are used to perform any specific action.

Note:- All algorithms are programs but not all programs are algorithms.

time complexity - The time taken by a program to get excuted is called time complexity.

Asymptotic notations - 
1. Worst case (big O) - maximum time taken by a program to execute. Denoted by Big O.
2. Average case (theta) - Average time taken by a program to execute. Denoted by Theta.
3. best case (omega) - the least time taken by a program to execute. Denoted by Omega.
 
Space complexity - The amount of space taken by a program to get executed is called space complexity.

Note:- The program that has the least time and space complexity is called the optimal code or the optimum solution.
